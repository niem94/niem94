My name is Nikolai Emil Damm. I am currently working as a software engineer at in Digitalization at Energinet.

- 🌱 I'm currently exploring k8s and migrating my homelab to dev, staging and prod cluster environments with GitOps (FluxCD). The aim is to have a setup that is replicable, highly available, and promotable, such that changes deployed to a dev environment can be promoted to production. The end result should rely on the smart use of CI/CD with GitHub Actions.
- 🔭 I'm currently working in Digitalisation at Energinet.
- 💬 Ask me about anything. I love to meet new people and discuss technologies, interests and knowledge.
